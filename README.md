# Project - 1 : Indianapolis Weather Analysis (2020 - 2025)
**This assignment presents a comprehensive analysis of Indianapolis weather trends from February 
2020 to February 2025 using data obtained from the Open-Meteo API. Through an interactive 
dashboard created in Quarto with Shiny, we explore key weather variables including temperature, 
wind speed, and precipitation. The analysis reveals seasonal patterns, extremes, and yearly trends 
in weather, which are visualized using time series plots, Bar/Box plots, and interactive UI. This 
exercise demonstrates critical data analysis skills such as API data acquisition, wrangling, 
visualization, and communication of insights.
