# Project - 1 : Indianapolis Weather Analysis (2020 - 2025)
This project involved analyzing weather trends in Indianapolis from February 2020 to February 2025 using data from the Open-Meteo API. I leveraged R for data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and visualization, providing valuable insights into temperature, wind speed, and precipitation patterns.

Data Acquisition: I used R packages httr and jsonlite to retrieve daily and hourly weather data, including temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and snowfall, from the Open-Meteo API. The data was parsed from JSON format into a structured data frame for analysis.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: I cleaned the data by handling missing values, converting dates to Date objects, and creating seasonal categories (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). This allowed for more targeted analysis, such as identifying temperature extremes and seasonal weather variations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I used visualizations such as time series plots, box plots, and bar charts to explore:

Temperature Trends: Revealing seasonal changes, with summer peaks and winter troughs.

Precipitation Distribution: Highlighting variability across seasons, especially intense rainfall in Spring and Summer.

Wind Speed Fluctuations: Identifying wind peaks during winter months and seasonal transitions.

Interactive Dashboard: I developed an interactive dashboard using Quarto and Shiny, enabling users to explore the weather data dynamically. Key features include a date range selector and a weather variable toggle, allowing users to filter data and examine specific weather metrics.

This project showcases my expertise in data wrangling, visualization, and building interactive tools that facilitate data-driven decision-making. It demonstrates the use of R programming and Quarto for creating insightful, real-world applications that make weather data accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

# Project - 2 : HR Analytics Dashboard : PowerBi
Developed a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to provide data-driven insights into workforce management. The dashboard integrates multiple datasets to track employee demographics, attrition trends, hiring patterns, performance analytics, and workforce diversity.

Key Features & Functionalities:
Employee Demographics & Diversity Analysis: Visualized workforce distribution based on age, gender, department, and experience levels to support HR in building a diverse and inclusive workplace.
Attrition & Retention Insights: Identified trends in employee turnover, analyzed reasons for attrition, and provided predictive insights to improve retention strategies.
Performance & Productivity Metrics: Tracked employee performance based on KPIs, enabling HR teams to identify top performers and areas for improvement.
Recruitment & Hiring Trends: Monitored hiring rates, department-wise recruitment efficiency, and new hire success rates to optimize hiring processes.
ETL & Data Processing: Implemented data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipelines to clean and preprocess HR data for accurate reporting.
Advanced DAX Measures & Calculations: Used DAX functions to create custom metrics for turnover rates, average tenure, and employee satisfaction scores.
Interactive & Dynamic Visualizations: Designed filter-enabled reports, allowing users to drill down into specific departments, roles, and time frames.
Automation & Real-time Updates: Integrated with HR databases and Excel sheets to enable automated data refreshes and real-time workforce monitoring.
This dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for HR teams, helping them identify workforce trends, streamline recruitment, and enhance employee engagement strategies. It empowers leadership with data-driven insights to optimize talent management, workforce planning, and overall HR efficiency.
