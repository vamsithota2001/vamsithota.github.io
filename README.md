# Project - 1 : Indianapolis Weather Analysis (2020 - 2025)
This assignment presents a comprehensive analysis of Indianapolis weather trends from February 2020 to February 2025 using data obtained from the Open-Meteo API. Through an interactive dashboard created in Quarto with Shiny, we explore key weather variables including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. The analysis reveals seasonal patterns, extremes, and yearly trends in weather, which are visualized using time series plots, Bar/Box plots, and interactive UI. This exercise demonstrates critical data analysis skills such as API data acquisition, wrangling, visualization, and communication of insights.

This end-to-end data analysis assignment demonstrates strong data handling, visualization, and 
storytelling. The workflow—from raw data extraction to interactive storytelling—provides a 
model framework for real-world analytical reporting using R and Quarto. 
The assignment involved: 
• Data Acquisition via API, reflecting the ability to work with external data sources and web 
services. 
• Data Wrangling and Cleaning, including handling JSON formats, checking for missing 
values, converting date formats, and generating new features like seasonal 
categorizations. This demonstrates attention to detail and the ability to prepare data for 
meaningful insights. 
• Exploratory Data Analysis, where multiple trends were uncovered — such as seasonal 
temperature variations, wind speed fluctuations, and precipitation anomalies. These 
findings were visualized through time series plots, box plots, histograms, and maps. 
• Interactive Visualization, by integrating Shiny into the Quarto framework. This added a 
powerful dimension to the data story, allowing end-users to filter and explore trends 
based on date ranges and variable selection—just like a real-world stakeholder would 
need. 
• Insightful Storytelling, with clear visual explanations and contextual interpretations of 
weather behavior over a five-year period in Indianapolis.
